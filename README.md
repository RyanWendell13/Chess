Title:
    Chess

Description:
    A web based chess game

How To Play:
    Above and below the board are two boxes saying "Player One" and "Player Two". These show whose turn it is. When a box has a black border around it that means it's that players turn. Simply click on a piece to move. It will highlight all possible moves the piece can make. Click on one of the highlighted tiles to move to it. When a king is in check a blue line from the checking piece to the king will be created.

Know Issues:
    If restarting the game through the restart button or new game button doesn't work use the refresh button in the browser.
